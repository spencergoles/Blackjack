# Blackjack

## Challenge: 

Build a console-based (i.e. runs in terminal) unix-compatible interactive card game. You can pick Blackjack, Solitaire, Memory, or any other game of your choosing (please include game rules in this case). Please provide your submission as a link. 

## How You Will Be Assessed

You will be assessed on your creativity and the quality of your code and design document. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Does the game work, i.e. is it possible to play a complete game of the card game you chose?
How thoughtful were your system design decisions?
Is the game designed well / easily playable?
Is the code organized, modular, and well-factored?
What edge cases were considered and accounted for?

## Design Document should include: 

Instructions for running your code and any tests you may have written
Rules for your card game, if not one of the three listed above
A brief explanation of your design choices and any data structures or algorithms that you implemented
Choice of tooling (language, libraries, test runner, etc.) and rationale behind those choices.

## Other Notes:
The card game can be single or multiplayer
Many card games rely on the cards of a player being hidden from other players. You may want to consider implementing such a feature.
Feel free to use any programming language.
Please cite any external libraries that you use.
We suggest you spend no more than 3 hours on this challenge.
